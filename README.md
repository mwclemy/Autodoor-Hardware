# Autodoor-Hardware

This Github repo reepresents the hardware part of the Autodoor project, with which you can find a detailed info at [Autodoor-Project](https://github.com/mwclemy/Autodoor-Project).
## Relevant Links and Libraries
This hack makes use of several other projects. Here are some links to things you'll need/want:
* [GSM Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/GSM) : This library enables an Arduino board to do most of the operations you can do with a GSM phone: place and receive voice calls, send and receive SMS, and connect to the internet over a GPRS network.
* [Wifi Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFi) : This library allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet. It can serve as either a server accepting incoming connections or a client making outgoing ones. The library supports WEP and WPA2 Personal encryption, but not WPA2 Enterprise. Also note, if the SSID is not broadcast, the shield cannot connect.
* [Ethernet Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet) : This library allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet. It can serve as either a server accepting incoming connections or a client making outgoing ones. The library supports up to four concurrent connection (incoming or outgoing or a combination).
